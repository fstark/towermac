# TowerMac, a Macithosh themed tower defense

## TowerMac is a simple tower defense SDL game with the aim of ultimately porint it to the SE/30

The game takes place on an original Macintosh 128K motherboard

The player will have to defend the 68000 from the attacks of 8 computers from the 80's.

Current design:

The player will be allowed to place only one tower at each round, ending the game with 8 towers.

Each round will be composed of 3 waves of enemies + a "boss" wave.

Towers can only be placed at specific locations (on top of existing chips)

Random powerups that improve towers will be available after each wave of enemies. A set of 3 powerups will be proposed, and user will be able to choose one

Powerup examples:

* ROM speedup: towers placed on ROM have +20% firerate

* 32 bits-clean ROM: tower placed on roms deal 30% more daamge

* IWM: the tower placed on the IWM will automatically fire at the closest enemy

* Video beam: placing a tower on the video connector will make the itself and the 2 closest tower piercing

* Simasimac : all towers get a burst pattern firing rate [?]
